I want to implment a singleton for the gameInstance class, 
so that you can only launch one game from a machine at a time.

I want to implement a Decorator for the classes, roles, and equitment.
This will be the best design pattern to implement these systems

I want to implement a state patern for the turn based system.
Each turn is a state with a finite set of moves, player state, enemy state, 
in cycles until the enemy's health goes below zero, 
the state will than go to the rest phase.
